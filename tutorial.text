In the context of the Health Inequality Data Repository (HIDR) API:

Download: The "Download" function is used to download specific files from the HIDR. You can use it to download the latest version of both the data and metadata files,
 the latest version of either a data or a metadata file, or a specific version of a data or metadata file. The downloaded files can be in various formats such as .xlsx or .pdf, 
 or a ZIP file containing both data and metadata files. The Download function requires you to specify the dataset ID and optionally the version date of the data or metadata file 
 you wish to download​1​.

Files: The "Files" function, on the other hand, is used to list the existing files in the HIDR. It returns a list of files in a specific dataset in the HIDR. 
This can be useful if you want to see what files are available in a dataset before you decide to download them. 
The API responses from the Files function are returned in JSON format. This function requires you to specify the dataset ID​1​.

In essence, the "Files" function gives you information about the existing files in a dataset, while the "Download" function allows you to download these files.
